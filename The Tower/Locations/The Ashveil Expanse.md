  - Location

- A scorched, battle-ridden frontier known for **wandering warbands and cursed ruins**. One of the few truly desolate warzones in [[The Tower]].
    
- The landscape: blackened earth, smoking craters, occasional skeletal trees, and rolling gray fog. The inn is the only place untouched — which makes its perfection **both alluring and unnerving**.
    
- Locals or surviving scouts whisper about _“[[The Hearth in the Ash]]”_, a legendary safe haven said to appear in the Expanse, though most fear it as too perfect to be real.
