Location: [[The Ashveil Expanse]], Floor ??, [[The Tower]]
*Mood: Comfort laced with unease — too perfect, too preserved.*

---
#### Arrival

Amid the desolation, the party spots a warmly glowing inn standing untouched — The Laughing Hearth. The sign creaks faintly, untouched by ash or battle. Inside, laughter and the clinking of mugs fill the air. Wounded soldiers, adventurers, even monsters who should be enemies all drink side by side in uncanny peace.

A faint golden shimmer runs along the windowsills — a protective enchantment, though none can say from what.

Behind the bar hangs an old parchment covered in ancient script, and in front of it stands Innkeeper [[Malvren, the Laughing Broker|Malvren]], a charming middle-aged man with eyes too sharp for his grin.

“Welcome, travelers! The Hearth is a safe zone — no blades drawn, no blood spilled, only rest and good company.”

---
#### The Drinks

[[Malvren, the Laughing Broker|Malvren]] offers a special brew called [[The Hearth's Comfort]], saying it “warms the soul and wards off the outside cold.”

---
#### The Stay

At nightfall, [[Malvren, the Laughing Broker|Malvren]] insists anyone who drank must stay.
“Rules of the safe zone, you see — can’t have drunkards wandering into battlefields. The rooms are yours for the night. Don’t worry about the price; I promise to keep it fair… though we’ll have to settle the bill at the end of your stay. Inn’s rules.”

The rooms are immaculately clean — each with a soft bed, private bath, and even a locking door. Your characters are overjoyed to discover that finding such luxury in the middle of [[The Ashveil Expanse]] was actually the goal of your quest.

Over the next few days, the inn becomes the party’s base. Each morning, [[Malvren, the Laughing Broker|Malvren]] greets them with a smile, and each night, he says:

“Don’t worry about paying yet — we’ll settle the bill at the end. Just keep our assets safe.”  
	*(He means the players, not the rooms.)*

#### The Third Night

That night, as they head to bed, all music stops. The chatter below fades into silence.

*Any character with divine or otherworldly ties feels something wrong.*
##### Perception Check:

- DC 16 + number of drinks consumed across their stay.    
    
###### - Success from anyone:  
      
	“You realize this isn’t mere unease — it’s a warning. The air feels dead. You look around and everything seems fine. The walls and doors look the same as before…yet your hair refuses to stop standing on end. As you strain to listen for any sign of something wrong, you hear nothing. It’s peaceful and quiet…but something’s missing…since when did you stop hearing the bar downstairs?”  
      
###### - Failure from all members:
    
	The first player to approach their door which they left unlocked, will take 2d6 damage and the party will be surprised as…  
  
Shadowy claws begin to tear through the doors of (any character with an unlocked door). A hissing voice comes from the door closest to the party, mocking, “You forgot to lock your door.” 
	*(Entities in rooms will take 1 full turn to tear through doors, or will use their free surprise turn to do so on a fail).*

[[Malvren, the Laughing Broker|Malvren]] laughter echoes through the halls — distorted yet gleeful. Your stomach churns with fear… and something else. The warmth of [[The Hearth's Comfort]] twists cold inside you. Every drink you’ve had turns against you.

#### The Twist

[[Malvren, the Laughing Broker|Malvren]] true nature: a soul broker, bound to a long-forgotten pact with gods of hospitality and debt.  
Every guest who stays without negotiating a price becomes part of the tab.

A familiar divine voice rings out. You recognize it to belong to [[Eryndor, the Just Hand]], whose aide [[Seraphine Vale]] helped you before:

“You fools! You stayed at [[Malvren, the Laughing Broker|Malvren]] Inn and never once asked his price! Now he claims the default payment — your lives! Escape. Request my aid and I shall help you, but the cost will not be light. Let this teach you: all boons bear a burden.”

###### Acceptance:

Divine Insight: for the next minute, each player has advantage on Wisdom saves and one free reaction to resist possession/charm.

Each player receives a small marble. When they crush it as a bonus action, some version of divine aid will occur, but the sigil of the god will appear on the arms of players who used it after the battle.

###### Refusal:

Players will have to fight alone without aid, though if they are party wiped then the god will automagically intervene.

---
#### Combat Begins

- [[Malvren, the Laughing Broker|Malvren]], the Laughing Broker (CR adjusted to party level): Uses [[Shadow Guest]] as minions — distorted reflections of people the party met. 
    
- The Inn itself becomes hostile: doors lock, furniture shifts, chandeliers drop as [[Animated Furniture]] begin to join in the fight.  
---
#### Resolution

If they escape or defeat [[Malvren, the Laughing Broker|Malvren]], the inn collapses into smoke, leaving only a charred sign reading:

`The Laughing Hearth — Always Settle Your Tab. We hope you had a wonderful stay!`

If they fail, they awaken on the ground, morning light spilling in, memories hazy, with no inn, but a sign instead saying:

`Bill still unpaid...`
