## Celestiar: City of the Gods
They say the gods built Celestiar not as a kingdom, but as a **promise**—a sanctuary where divinity brushed against mortal life, and perfection was no myth but stone and sky entwined.

Rising from the heart of the continent, **Celestiar** crowns a colossal plateau that pierces the heavens. Its walls—smooth, silver-white, and impossibly tall—descend all the way to the plains below, their bases vanishing into mist. Legends claim they were poured from the molten bones of the earth and cooled by divine breath, rendering them unbreakable by time, tool, or siege. Armies have gathered at their feet, empires have plotted its conquest, and yet none have ever breached its radiant shell. Celestiar was untouchable, unreachable—**a city above all others**.

### **The City Above the World**

Within its sanctified bounds, life transcended the frailties of the mortal world. The air itself was lighter, touched by the mountain’s breath; water that flowed from its fountains glittered like glass and carried whispers of healing. **No plague dared enter, no sickness ever lingered.** To live in Celestiar was to live free of decay, a being halfway between man and god.

The citizens—known as **the Celestii**—were paragons among mortals. Their bodies brimmed with divine vigor, their eyes alight with that quiet, celestial spark. They wielded strength enough to lift stone columns, leap battlements, or labor without exhaustion. Though their magics were faint, they were constant: lights that obeyed their touch, gardens that grew lush at their voice, metals that shaped more easily in their hands.

They were not conquerors nor hermits; they were _guardians_—watchers of the lesser lands below. Traders and pilgrims journeyed for months to reach the plateau’s foot, their goods exchanged by pulley and spell rather than gate, for the ascent was forbidden. To step within Celestiar’s walls was to cross into something sacred.

### **Architecture of the Divine**

The city’s streets were vast and clean, paved with pale stone that shimmered faintly under the sun. **Obelisks** rose at intersections, inscribed with golden runes said to record the gods’ first words. Every building, from the humblest home to the soaring **Hall of Ascendance**, carried beauty and symmetry in its bones—arches that framed the horizon, towers that seemed to reach for eternity.

At the city’s heart stood the **Sanctum Aeternum**, a great temple of white marble and azure glass. Its dome reflected the entire sky, earning Celestiar its second name: _The City of Heavens Mirrored._

### **The Eternal Peace**

Generations passed, and the Celestii forgot fear. Children grew without tears, soldiers trained without war, healers studied wounds they would never see. Peace had dulled the edge of vigilance, and prosperity had become their birthright. The city’s festivals honored gods who no longer spoke, and their hymns echoed more from memory than faith.

And this is where we begin our fated adventure. Welcome everyone, to the city of Celestiar. Now if you all would like to introduce your characters, we can get this grand adventure started.

*After Introductions:*

Get characters to one by one find out that they have guard duty at the **Sanctum Aeternum**, then begin the quest, [[Daily Life]].




Plot Point:
The party will eventually find out that the reason why Celestiar was so prosperous and why the Celestii are so strong is due to the influence of [[The Tower]]. See, [[The Tower]] always existed, but it didn't materialize until certain points of history. Then Celestiar would be wiped from the map, and rebuilt from [[The Tower]], almost like a breeding ground for new challengers who might eventually become gods, and hopefully they can conquer [[The Tower]].
