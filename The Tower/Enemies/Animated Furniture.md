### Running the Encounter

- At the start of combat, 2–3 pieces of furniture animate (1 table, 1 chandelier, maybe a barstool swarm (like magic missile but a landmine version).  
      
- Every 2 rounds, roll a d4: on a 4, another piece animates.  
      
- If the party destroys the contract sigil, all animated objects instantly collapse and the shadows dissipate.
