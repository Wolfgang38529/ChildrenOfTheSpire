A drink imbued with [[Malvren, the Laughing Broker|Malvren]]'s power of contract, which is enforced by [[The Tower]].
### Beneficial
Effect progression per drink:
1. First drink: Gain 3 temporary hit points (last until leaving the area).  
    
2. Second drink: Gain +1 to all Charisma checks within the tavern.  
    
3. Third drink: All tavern guests treat you as a friendly acquaintance.  
    
4. Fourth drink: Gain 10 temporary hit points (stacking with previous). 
      
5. Fifth drink: Gain advantage on all checks made within the tavern. 

All effects last only while within the Hearth or the surrounding battlefield. No one feels drunk — just pleasantly relaxed.

### Negative
Reversal of drink buffs:  
1. Lose all temporary HP and take 1d3 damage per drink consumed.  
    
2. –1 to all Charisma checks.  
    
3. Disadvantage on all skill checks within the tavern; enemies gain +2 AC against you.  
    
4. Take 10 psychic damage. 
    
5. Disadvantage on your first attack each round; enemies gain advantage on their first saving throw against you.

The players can try to appeal to their deity/patron to reduce the curse’s effects or shatter the inn’s contract sigil (hidden under the bar) to end the binding altogether.
