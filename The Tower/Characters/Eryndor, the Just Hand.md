The god of Justice, Oaths, and Protection of the Innocent within [[The Tower]].
**Appearance:** Radiant figure in flowing silver and blue robes, often seen with a glowing gauntlet on their right hand. Their aura conveys authority tempered with mercy.  
**Personality / Lore Tie-In:**

- The party has encountered **Eryndor’s emissary** before — a silver-armored paladin named [[Seraphine Vale]] — who aided them in an earlier battle or quest. This gave them a **favorable impression**: Eryndor is fair, just, and protective of those who act with honor.
    
- Eryndor **rewards those who keep their word** and punishes those who abuse hospitality, deceit, or greed. This makes the inn encounter’s moral weight stronger, as the players have already been “seen” by this deity.
