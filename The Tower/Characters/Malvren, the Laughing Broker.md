### Innkeeper’s Aura.

Creatures within 30 feet of Malvren who can see him must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or feel a supernatural sense of comfort and safety.  
While affected, they have disadvantage on Insight checks against him and cannot willingly attack him until he takes a hostile action.

---
### Contract Mastery.

Any creature that accepts Malvren’s hospitality (a drink, meal, or room) is considered under contract. Breaking this agreement (attacking Malvren or refusing payment) allows him to impose one of the following effects as a reaction (DC 15 Charisma save):

- The creature’s speed is halved until the end of its next turn.  
      
- The creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage as its life force “pays interest.”  
      
- The creature’s attack automatically misses as their hand freezes mid-strike.

### Innkeeper’s Grin (Recharge 5–6).

Malvren distorts his face into a horrific grin. Each creature of his choice within 30 ft. that can see him must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 21 (6d6) psychic damage and be frightened for 1 minute.  
A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

---
### Shadowy Contract (Recharge 2-3).

Malvren targets a creature that has drunk The Hearth’s Comfort. Using a bonus action, the shadow of that creature rises up, becoming a [[Shadow Guest]] (use Shadow stat block with +20 HP). The guest attacks its original until destroyed.

---
### Multiattack.

Malvren makes two Soul Rend attacks.

Soul Rend. Melee Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on Charisma checks until the end of its next turn.

---
### Legendary Actions (2/round)

Malvren can take 3 legendary actions, using one option at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn.

1. Whispered Contract. Target one creature within 30 ft. that can hear him. DC 15 Charisma save or be Charmed until the end of their next turn.  
      
2. Moving Shadow. He teleports up to 20 ft. to an unoccupied space he can see, leaving behind a shadowy echo that attacks once (+6 to hit, 1d8 necrotic).  
      
3. Soul Tax (Costs 2 Actions). All creatures under contract take 5 (1d10) necrotic damage.

## Lair: The Laughing Hearth

When Malvren fights within the inn, the building itself aids him as [[Animated Furniture]] springs to his aide along with shadows of past debtors ([[Shadow Guest]]).  
On initiative count 20, Malvren or the inn can take a Lair Action:

1. Shifting Rooms. All doors lock or unlock at Malvren’s choice. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dex save or be moved 10 ft. as walls warp.  
      
2. Haunting Memories. Echoes of laughter whisper in the party’s ears. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom save or suffer disadvantage on the next attack or check.  
      
3. Living Furniture. A table or chandelier animates and attacks (use Animated Armor or Flying Sword stats).  
      
4. Bill Comes Due (Recharge 6). All debuffed drinkers take 2d4 necrotic damage.

### Combat Notes & Tactics

- Malvren avoids direct melee; he uses his aura and charm effects to manipulate.  
      
- His first goal is to frighten or charm as many guests as possible, turning them into easy prey for his [[Shadow Guest]] warriors.  
      
- Once threatened, he uses Shadowy Contract and Soul Tax to drain the party’s resources.  
      
- If reduced to 0% HP
	 Malvren raises one hand as if to say "stop" and suddenly power surges from him. All characters understand that this isn't an entity they can defeat, let alone fight, but he ends combat saying:  
    
    “I've received the payment in full. Thank you for your patronage dear guests.  Please visit [[The Laughing Hearth]] again in the future.”  
    
	His body then dissolves into black smoke, leaving behind an ornate coin as a note saying "A gift for my dear customers". The coin is called [[Shadow's Gamble]]

### Scaling Notes

- CR 6 (Easier): Reduce HP to 100, DCs to 14, remove legendary actions.  
      
- CR 10 (Harder): Raise HP to 170, DCs to 17, increase Soul Rend to 3d8+4, and add one more Legendary Action:  
    “Soul Mirror.” Reflects the next spell or ranged attack back at the caster.
