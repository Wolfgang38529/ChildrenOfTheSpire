Each player has on them only their wage for guard duty (20 SP) as anything else is prohibited in the Sanctum Aeternum.  

And then, **the earth began to tremble.**

At first, it was thought to be a storm beneath the ground—a quake soon to pass. But when the tremors did not cease, the people gathered at the Sanctum’s steps, gazing toward the plains below. There, from the shadow of the plateau, **the earth split open** and something vast began to rise: a **tower** of obsidian and light, growing higher and higher, as if to pierce the very vault of heaven.

As the tower’s peak drew level with the city walls, a sound like a thousand bells filled the air. Then came the light—**a veil of shimmering glyphs** that appeared before every eye. Words none had ever seen burned into sight:

> “**Welcome, Challenger. Tutorial initializing.**”

From the tower’s base, monsters spill forth—creatures of shadow and molten bone. Some Celestii immediately jump forth, confident in their extreme strength having been unmatched for eons, and wondering if these creatures are messengers from the gods. A man steps forth: "State your purpose here," he commands. Silence hangs in the air as each second seems drawn out with anticipation, then all that can be seen is a blur as one monster lunges and tears through the man with ease. His pained screams resound through the streets and after a brief silence, chaos erupts.

Celestii run for their lives, their immense strength now made useless before this new threat. The monsters relentlessly give chase, mercilessly slaughtering any their claws can reach. And above it all, the tower continues to rise, endless and cold, **as if mocking the city that once believed itself eternal.**

What would you all like to do?

After surviving for an hour, a new system message appears: 
> “**[Part 1 of the Tutorial](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Quests%2FTower%20Quests%2FTutorial%20(pt.1)) will now commence.**”
