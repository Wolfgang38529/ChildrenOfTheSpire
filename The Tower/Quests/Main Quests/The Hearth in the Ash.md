### **Quest Hook**

The party is sent to **defeat a powerful monster** terrorizing the Ashveil Expanse. Scouts and legends claim that **The Laughing Hearth**, a magically preserved inn in the battlefield, holds knowledge of the monster’s **location and weakness**.

A **wounded scout** approaches:

> “I saw it myself… a place where enemies sit together drinking, unharmed. They said it’s called _The Laughing Hearth._ I tried to stay…but I felt wrong…so I quickly gave the owner some coin and left. I must get going. I can't be in this wretched battlefield any longer.”

The party is tasked with **locating the inn** to gain the vital information, and the quest upgrades to [[The Laughing Hearth]].
